# Simple Quantum PC simulation // C++
## C++ Quantum PC simulation with usage of Hadamard Gate.

The **Hadamard Gate** is a fundamental quantum gate used in quantum computing and quantum information theory.
When applied to a qubit in the state |0⟩, the Hadamard gate transforms it to the state |+⟩ (an equal superposition of |0⟩ and |1⟩), and when applied to a qubit in the state |1⟩, it changes it to the state |-⟩ (the negative superposition of |0⟩ and |1⟩). I wrote a **C++** model of quantum PC according to structure of Hadamard Gate func.

## Here is the mathematical representation of Hadamard Gate:
